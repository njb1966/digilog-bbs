                      FOR THOSE HAVING TROUBLE...


Problem:  It locks up at 'Returning to the Mundane Realm'.  HELP!

Solution: Use a locked fossil driver at 19200, 38400 or 57600.  This will
          fix com routine freeze problems.                          

Problem:  Seems weird under Win 95 - Why?

Solution: Set idle sensitivity to LOW - You can do this by editting the
          PROPERTIES setting for you dos window.  You know you have it set
          right when the status screen on the bottom alternates between
          "Legend Of The Red Dragon" and "Press Alt-H for help" WITHOUT a
          key being pressed.

Problem:  I set it to DIGI, but it don't work with my digiboard.

Solution: DIGI support was taken out.  LORDCFG has not been updated, so
          it doesn't know this.  Use another fossil setting, using DIGI
          fossil emulators, it will work with "Regular Fossil" setting.


Problem:  LORD always runs the same IGM, no matter what the user picks!
          (and other misc IGM problems)

Solution:  You didn't overwrite your 3.26a game with the *NEW* START.BAT file
           that was included with 3.53.  It has dramatically changed, and
           needs to be upgraded.

           Be sure to edit it, and change the top part to your LORD path
           where it shows.  

Problem:  I have a bug report, or problem not addressed anywhere in the
          LORD.DOC file!  I want to bug you about it!


Solution: Great, we love to get feedback!  But please fill out BUGRPT.FRM
          and send/e-mail that.  That way, we know more about your system
          ect, and don't have to prod you for that info later.

          If you do NOT use this medium, and instead say: "LORD ain't working
          right, fix it", don't expect a helpful answer!!! <G>

Problem:  I sometimes have erotic dreams about Violet and/or Seth Able.

Solution: Have not a clue.  If you find out, lemmie know.
