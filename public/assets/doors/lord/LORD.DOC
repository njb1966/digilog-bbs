   When you received the Legend of the Red Dragon archive, the following files
*SHOULD* be present. If any are missing, please call The Darkside BBS and
download a fresh copy.

LORD.DOC     : This is what you are reading now.... duh..!
REGISTER.DOC : The registration form. You can print this out with LORDCFG. You
               can also fill it out and still print it out with LORDCFG.
SUPPORT.DOC  : A list of Seth Able Support BBS's.
START.BAT    : This is ALWAYS used to start Legend of the Red Dragon. There are
               *no* exceptions to this one.
LOCAL.BAT    : Use this to play Legend of the Red Dragon locally.
DOATTRIB.BAT : Puts the READ ONLY attribute on four of Legend of the Red
               Dragon's files. This is included for compatibility on Lantastic
               systems. Since not all systems need this, is was put in to make
               the SysOp's life a little bit easier.
NOATTRIB.BAT : Removes the READ ONLY attribute from four of Legend of the Red
               Dragon's files. You need to run this if you are installing a new
               version, or updating an older version of Legend of the Red

   Is this product crippled or what?

   Yep, this is Shareware. This allows you, the consumer to try out this
product, before you decide to plunk down some cold hard cash for it. As a matter
of fact, nearly half of the registrations we have received have been paid for by
USERS!

   But, this is a fully operational to the users until they hit level 6. They
will not be able to continue until the game is registered.

If I register, What do I get?

   When you register Legend of the Red Dragon, you will get a unique
registration code with your name on it, printed JUST for you!

   This code can be easily entered with LORDCFG.EXE. Just use "(E)nter
Registration Code". Once entered, the entire game will be functional.

   What this gets you:

   Twice as many levels and enemies.

   The game can be finished. (Players can go beyond level 6).

   (V)isit the Hall of Honor option in (T)urgon's Warrior Training will actually
   be useful. This ranks heros, depending on how many heroic deeds they have
   done.

   The Player Editor in LORDCFG will allow you to save changes.

   You can change the number of forest fights and player fights a player is
   allowed to have.

   By supporting quality shareware such as this, you are making Legend of the
   Red Dragon a bigger and better game.

   FREE UPDATES! All future versions of Legend of the Red Dragon will work with
   your registration code. Actually getting the updates will be left up to you.

Wow! I love this game! HOW do I register?

   First, remember the wonderful thing about shareware - you get to "Try before
you buy" this game. What this means is that you know *exactly* what you are
getting before you pay for it.

   If you are unhappy with ANY part of the operation, DO NOT send cash expecting
it to work better. Registering Legend of the Red Dragon simply lets you play the
second half of the game, and defeat the infamous Red Dragon.

   If you are having problems, call us for technical support BEFORE registering.
We offer support to users whether or not they have registered Legend of the Red
Dragon.
 
   If you DO NOT operate a BBS, you can still register the game for home use.
Many people have done this already.
   
   Use the (*) Print Registration Form" option in LORDCFG. It will print the
REGISTER.DOC file. It's ok to edit REGISTER.DOC and fill it out with your
information before you print out the file. Or, just fill it out with pen after
it's printed. (You can print REGISTER.DOC with any program you want!).

   If you do not have a printer, try to basically send us the same information,
and if we can find a return address, we will send you a registration code for
Legend of the Red Dragon.

   Legend of the Red Dragon (LORD) is a multi-player battle game created for
Bulletin Board Systems (BBS's). Legend of the Red Dragon can also be played
locally by running the LOCAL.BAT from the DOS prompt.

   Legend of the Red Dragon supports:

   * DesqView, Windows, and OS/2.

   * Support for most dropfile types: DORINFOx.DEF, PCBOARD.SYS, CHAIN.TXT,
   INFO.BBS, CALLINFO.BBS, DOOR.SYS, SFDOORS.DAT, JUMPER.DAT, and TRIBBS.SYS.

   * IRQ 0-15 and selectable COM port address supported for nonstandard COM 
   ports.

   * CTS/RTS flow handshaking, locked baud rates, and support up to 115,200 baud
   rates.

   * Internal communications routines supported.

   * FOSSIL driver support.

   * Locked FOSSIL driver support.

   * True multi-node support. (Send online message, battles, and such!).

   * Lock out any player you don't like by putting their name in the LOCKOUT.DAT
   file. Legend of the Red Dragon will display LOCKOUT.TXT when the user tries
   to enter the game. You can edit this file if you wish.

   * Automatic RIP detection and support.

   * Optionally will create ANSI/ASCII score files with any path and name in
   LORDCFG. Great option if you wish to display the Legend of the Red Dragon
   scores as a bulletin on your BBS.

   * In-game downloading of LORDICON.ZIP, which is the file RIP users need to
   plat Legend of the Red Dragon. It contains all the icons needed to use RIP
   graphics. Legend of the Red Dragon will auto detect if the user is using RIP,
   what version, and if they do not have the Legend of the Red Dragon icons. If
   they do not have the icons, Legend of the Red Dragon will give them the
   option of downloading them. *NOTE* You will need to obtain a copy of an
   external protocol driver such as GSZ.EXE if you wish the in-game downloading
   of the Legend of the Red Dragon icons to work. Also, you must set this path
   in LORDCFG.

   * Auto Maintenance as the first person of the day plays Legend of the Red
   Dragon. Entire maintenance process takes less than 4 seconds on most systems.

   * Auto deletion of inactive players. This is set via LORDCFG.

   * "Smart Deletes" of users. If your BBS is down for an extended period of
   time, Legend of the Red Dragon will not count those days against the player.





Legend of the Red Dragon 4.02                                  Page 5
   * Ultra easy to run. You don't have to do anything, ever. On the other hand,
   LORDCFG will allow the SysOp to become as involved with Legend of the Red
   Dragon as he wants to be. Define many rules and enable/disable certain
   options. *NOTE* Not all options are available in the unregistered version.)

   * Powerful player editor. *NOTE* Can only save if the game is registered.

   * Inactivity timeout at 3 minutes. If a player does not touch the keyboard in
   over 3 minutes, he will be removed from the game. No matter of security
   level.

   * SysOp can chat with the user in Legend of the Red Dragon. Use ALT-C to
   chat, and ESCape to finish.

   * Players play an average of 10 minutes per day (at standard settings). The
   perfect game to compliment an active message base. In fact, that's why it was
   written. Keeps 'em coming back for more EACH DAY!

   * Lots of professional RIP graphics. You gotta play to believe it!

   * Special Skills! Players can take their pick of being a "Death Knight",
   "Mystical Skills User", or a student of the "Thieving Skills." Or, become the
   ultimate warrior and learn them all!

   * "Never Reset" game play. New approach to gaming! When a player successfully
   beats the Red Dragon, only *he* is reset. He does keep his special skills he
   has acquired, as well as his charm, children, and status in "The Old Man's
   Rankings."

   * Much more text. Log "lementings" can be easily edited for a personalized
   game!
   
   * Smart Mode: Users are automatically informed when another player enters the
   realm while they are online. Or leaves. Or sends a message. (Via messenger on
   horseback!)

   * More interactive forest events. Many "secrets" to discover.

   * Hundreds of ways for players to interact.

   * Players can get married and have kids!

   * DarkCloak Tavern. Hard to find, but VERY interesting when you do.

   * Powerful mail writing routines. Unlimited message length!

   * Tastefully lewd, and sort of tastefully gory!
   
   * A *FREE* upgrade to previously registered users! (As all upgrades are FREE
   for Seth Able Products.)

   * Reach new heights of conversation with "Characters" from the game.

   * Still only $15 bucks to register, the best value in doors today!

   * Single node systems that can multi-task can use the local option from DOS
   to play along with someone on the BBS. Just run LOCAL.BAT from the Legend of
   the Red Dragon directory.

ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

   Here's a step-by-step quick installation of Legend of the Red Dragon:

STEP ONE:

   Uncompress the LORD.ZIP archive into a directory of your choice.

STEP TWO:

   Edit the START.BAT with your favorite text editor. Change the top line to
   reflect the directory where you uncompressed Legend of the Red Dragon into.
   It will need to change to the Legend of the Red Dragon directory before
   executing anything else in the batch file.

STEP THREE:

   Run LORDCFG.EXE.

   In LORDCFG, go to (S)etup Nodes. This will allow you to configure baud rates,
   locked baud rates, COM ports, special port addresses (if needed)m the
   dropfile type your BBS makes, and where to find it.

   If you run a multi-node BBS, set up EACH dial in/remote node.

   Lazy Folks: Every time you set up a node that does not exist in LORDCFG, the
   new node configuration will be created with the defaults of the first node
   installed. So, if you have 200 nodes, it won't be a huge pain in the ass to
   set up all 200 of them.

STEP FOUR:

   Have your BBS execute the START.BAT. If you run just one node (A single line
   BBS), you need to have your BBS call START.BAT 1. The 1 is the node number.

   If you have a multi-node BBS, use a node parameter (in RemoteAccess, it's *N)
   so your BBS will substitute the appropriate node number.

TO PLAY LOCALLY:

   If you want to just play Legend of the Red Dragon locally, just start it with
   the LOCAL.BAT file.

   This part is included if you are having problems with Legend of the Red
Dragon.

Q: Uh... My network is simply not letting other nodes play when someone is    
   already in the game.

A: No one has ever asked that - BUT, if it does happen, it's possible you can
   fix it by typing "ATTRIB +R START.BAT" at the DOS prompt to make the
   START.BAT read only.

   Your network could be locking it away from the other users when someone is in
   Legend of the Red Dragon.

   But, since I don't use CALL in the batch file, it should be done with it
   completely when it changed to the LSS(node number).BAT automatically. So this
   scenario may never happen.

Q: Hey! It ain't making score bulletins like it should! Instead I'm getting a
   runtime error when someone quits. How can I fix this?

A: The Fix: When you entered the path of your ASCII and ANSI files in LORDCFG,
   did you forget to enter the NAME of the score files you want created?

   GO FIX IT!

Q: The game is saying someone else is playing the game, even though that user
   isn't on. What's up?

A: This is caused by the game turning off unexpectedly. For instance, a lock up,
   or a power failure. A carrier loss will not do this, Legend of the Red Dragon
   knows how to handle that, and will save all the players data before it
   returns to the BBS.

   The game will automatically fix it at maintenance the next morning, but you
   can also use the "(T)urn "On Now" Stat off for all players" option in
   LORDCFG.

Q: When a user enters the door, nothing happens, and he is returned back to the
   BBS! How can I get around this?

A: Check your BBS's execution string. It's probably not finding the file. It
   should look something like this:

   C:\BBS\DOORS\LORD\START.BAT 1

   ** OR **

   The problem could be Legend of the Red Dragon isn't getting enough memory.
   LORD requires 350k of CONVENTIONAL memory.

   You may need to tell your BBS to Swap to Disk instead of memory to get
   enough. WWIV SysOps: Use the Shrink BBS option.





Legend of the Red Dragon 4.02                                  Page 8
   If you are not sure how much memory your BBS is giving Legend of the Red
   Dragon, run MEM in a batch file somewhere and see how much CONVENTIONAL
   memory it shows. Legend of the Red Dragon will automatically load some of its
   files into EMS if you have it available.

Q: I am a multi-node system, but I can't figure out how to get my BBS to pass
   the node number for the node switch. What do I do?


A:  Check your BBS package manual/documentation. Most multi-node systems have a
   symbol you enter in the batch file which tells the BBS to substitute the node
   number. Something like: C:\BBS\DOORS\LORD\START.BAT %N or *N or something!

Q: Man, I'm multi-node, and I'm using the DORINFO1.DEF dropfile. But, when
   someone on node two plays, Legend of the Red Dragon says it "CANNOT FIND
   DORINFO2.DEF" My BBS uses the DORINFO1.DEF for all nodes. What do I do now?

A: No problems. Use "(S)etup Nodes with BBS" option in LORDCFG, and change your
   dropfile type to a DORINFO1.DEF dropfile type. Right after you do this, it
   will give you an option of reading a DORINFO1.DEF for ALL nodes, or the other
   way.

Q: The door just locks up on the intro ANSI! How do I fix this?

A: Lock ups are NOT a part of Legend of the Red Dragon. Most likely you can fix
   the problem by changing your setup. Choose "(S)etup Nodes with BBS" option in
   LORDCFG and try a different setup. With 4.02 , it's now very easy to change
   settings, like locked baud rate.

   PERHAPS you are using a FOSSIL driver, but have Legend of the Red Dragon set
   to use Internal COM Routines? Change it to "Regular Fossil" and see what
   happens.

   If that don't do it, try this:

   Try using a fossil driver. Some high speed modems will not function correctly
   with Legend of the Red Dragon's internal COM routines, and using a FOSSIL
   driver is the only way to run the game. DON'T GET SCARED! This does not have
   to interfere with your BBS in any way. You can download a FOSSIL driver from
   most BBS's. A couple of suggested drivers are: X00.SYS by Raymond Gwinn or
   BNU by David Nugent. Consult the FOSSIL driver documentation for information
   on how to install it.

   If your BBS ALREADY runs with a FOSSIL, skip the fossil installation stuff!

Q: I am multi-node, and I am running Legend of the Red Dragon with no problems -
   But every time I  see a <MORE> prompt, it stops the game for a second or
   more! Why?

A: This is file access. This is how players in Legend of the Red Dragon can list
   other players, and see other players scores going up WHILE they play.

   The game communicates entirely by your hard drive. This way, as long as two
   games or more are running from the same DIRECTORY, it will work with the 
   multi-node functions (Online battles, sending mail and such).

   The fix: You could try a disk cache program. I personally use SMARTDRV that
   comes with MS-DOS. I run it like this from my AUTOEXEC.BAT:

   SMARTDRV 2000

Legend of the Red Dragon 4.02                                  Page 9
   This allocates almost 2 megs of RAM for caching. You could use more or less. 
   I highly recommend a disk cache! The <MORE> prompts on my system are
   instantaneous.

   Be careful about "Delayed Writes." If you are having trouble, you may want to
   set the delay time to 0.

A: These are the options Legend of the Red Dragon can be run with in LORDx.BAT
(Where x = the node 
   number) : 

   (You can use them in any order).

    COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS
    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   
/L Local mode    
    
/Bxxx - Specify locked baud rate (i.e. /B38400)    
   
<number with no forward slash>   - Specify node number    
   
/R - Force RIP graphics (This will get you past the first detection phase
automatically. To manually pass the second, type RIP99999999  when you see the
Legend of the Red Dragon screen waiting for something)

/Pyyy - Specify path to drop file (i.e. /Pc:\bbs, this isn't used any more
because the drop file path can be set in LORDCFG, for each node. This option
will override what is in LORDCFG.EXE though)

More parms:  These do NOT use the / slash in front.

NOEMS - Forces LORD to NOT use EMS at all.  Helpfull if Desqview or something
        is crashing from EMM386 errors.

NORIP - Disabled the RIP detect entirely.

ANSI - Forces ANSI, regardless of what it reads from the drop file.

A line like this is accetable:

CALL START 1 ANSI NOEMS /L

And such.

º °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° What is RIP? And Why? °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° º
ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
                          by Seth Able (Not an expert).

If a user with RIPterm 2.0 tries to play Legend of the Red Dragon, it will work,
but RIPterm will convert the icons incorrectly. (It uses the standard palette
only)

BUT.. We have a solution. Let interested users download LORDRIP2.ZIP, a file
that is NOT included in this archive, (only the 1.54 version is, because at this
time 2.0 is not very popular) but you can download it from my system, or check
major online services. 

LORDRIP2.ZIP contains BMP's of the original artwork correctly converted.  
Nothing is new, just compatible with 2.0.  (And of course, the BMP version is
not compatible with pre 2.0 Ripterm)

What is RIP? Well, it's a terminal emulation sort of like ANSI, except it uses a
VGA mode with 16 colors.  (A 256 color version of Legend of the Red Dragon could
be in your future, but only if RIP 256 is standardized.)

RIP stands for (R)emote (I)maging (P)rotocol.

To view ANSI, you need an ANSI capable terminal program, right?  Well, same 
with RIP - Legend of the Red Dragon v4.02  was tested with RIPterm V1.54.02.  

Telix For Windows was also tested successfully.

If your Terminal program supports RIP emulation and does not work with Legend of
the Red Dragon,  take it up with them. Legend of the Red Dragon's RIP uses no
"illegal" or nonstandard commands - Write them a letter with your complaints and
perhaps they will update their  program to FULLY support RIP.

Anyway, it allows users to use a mouse with the game, and view some nice
graphics in spots. The non-graphic menus are about the same length as the ANSI 
ones, so speed isn't a problem - EXCEPT for the larger ones that hold a lot of 
information - The graphics.  

Legend of the Red Dragon lets users DOWNLOAD a file, (LORDICON.ZIP) which
contains all the hand drawn icons. They then put it in their ICONS directory,
(If they are using RIP, they have one!) and RIP then recalls screens when Legend
of the Red Dragon asks it to.

So the large graphic screens don't slow the game down any - Even your 300 baud
users will see the INTRO.RIP file at full speed. 

When a user calls using RIPterm, the game will automatically notice that. It
will also check to see if the user has the correct files on his HD. If he
DOESN'T, it will let him download the LORDICON.ZIP file IN THE GAME, providing 
you have GSZ.EXE or DSZ.EXE, and told Legend of the Red Dragon where it was in
LORDCFG.EXE.

Playing the game without downloading the icons (LORDICON.ZIP) is NOT
RECOMMENDED!






Legend of the Red Dragon 4.02                                  Page 11
It doesn't matter if your BBS supports RIP or not, Legend of the Red Dragon
will. You will see strange symbols on your screen, instead of menus. These are
the RIP codes, do not re-boot your computer! This is normal, as of yet, there is
no RIP.SYS like ANSI.SYS that will automatically display the VGA RIP, but then
again, it would  surely slow down your system - and no one wants that.

Is RIP going to become a new standard? I don't know. I just implement what
people ask for most.

If a user complains it's not working, it's probably because they don't have the
latest version of RIPterm, (It will actually tell them that though when they 
play) or they have not UNZIPPED the LORDICON.ZIP file into the ICONS directory  
on their HD.

If the download LORDICON.ZIP option IN Legend of the Red Dragon does not work on
your system, you may have to put up LORDICON.ZIP in your file bases, so they can
download it from there.  

Well, if you didn't know anything about RIP before, hopefully you do now.

º °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° Hints & Tips °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° º
ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

   This door will be an instant HIT on your system, and probably increase 
   activity in your message and file bases. *IF* it's given the chance.

   I used to run an Amiga BBS that had virtually no doors. I knew I needed a 
   hook, something to get people to call EVERY day and to catch up on the
   message bases and such, and keep the place busy and fun.

   That's when I created Legend of the Red Dragon, for that purpose alone. Here
   are some tips on getting a lot of people playing it, which makes it MORE fun:

   > Don't run too many doors. I know it sounds good to say "I've got over 100
   doors online!" But, you could have a more popular BBS if you only had about 5
   or 6 doors, so people would be literally FORCED to play with each other. One
   person playing each of your 100 doors a day is no fun.

   (** Wow! You're actually reading the docs? Here's a hint: Try hitting "1"
   from the Main Menu **)

   > I know lots of popular systems that run Legend of the Red Dragon alone,
   (Like mine... well, I run Planets: TEOS too of course!) and my system rings
   off the hook, not just long distance callers looking for the files, but local
   PLAYERS that come here because they KNOW that's all I have, so, of course
   they find a lot of competition. We have 150 players in our Legend of the
   Red Dragon game!

   > Make it easy to get to. I have my "Play Legend of the Red Dragon 4.02 "
   option on my Main Menu, so it's very visible. It's better than say, having to
   type "DOORS" then "1" for "RPG Doors" and finally ANOTHER key to actually
   play.

   > Announce that you have it. Especially if you are just installing it.

   > Don't get too crazy with turns. When you register the door, you have the 
   option of setting the "Fights per day" and such to a higher and lower value.
   But, don't overdo it. Remember that you want people to spend about 5-20
   minutes a day, not an hour. Too much time gets people burned out, and the fun
   of fighting with real people is calling DAILY to send messages back and forth
   and such.

   > Announce that Legend of the Red Dragon has RIP support, and put the newest
   version of RIPTERM up for downloading on your BBS.

   > Don't play. SysOps that play their own games are hard to beat, and players
   know this. If they find out YOU are the one they are competing with, chances
   are they will quit.

   If you are WINNING, (even playing fair) all hell will break loose!

   > Encourage Team Play. Although Legend of the Red Dragon has no special team
   menus, it does have something much more powerful, the ability for any player
   to send mail. With this, players make friends and enemies... I have a group
   on my system that call themselves "Black Knights" and they all have the
   letters BK in front of their names in Legend of the Red Dragon. Good idea!

                             ** FOR SOME REAL FUN **

   > Sometimes your players will get smart with chatting in the tavern, after a
   character from the game says something (because they know they can't really
   answer). You can blow their minds by editing your BAR.TXT file:

   Just *cut* the FIRST TWO lines, and *paste* them at the bottom of the file.
   Edit the name and text, and make sure the color is right for an NPC (looks
   like this: `0) and help the character answer back!

   > Now that Legend of the Red Dragon supports IGM's (In Game Modules), don't
   over populate your game with too many of them. Pick three to five of the best
   ones, and leave them alone. If you have too many of them, they tend to repeat
   themselves with the same features.

   Now, let's configure Legend of the Red Dragon!

   Change to the directory where you installed Legend of the Red Dragon, and at
the DOS prompt, type:

   LORDCFG

   You really don't need to put the .EXE on it, but if you feel safer doing it,
by all means, go ahead. You ain't gonna hurt anything!

   When LORDCFG is started initially, It has no LORD.DAT file. So, LORDCFG
presents you with a question:

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

  ** ERROR READING THE LORD.DAT FILE **

  This is either because you still have 3.03 data files, and have
  not run the 303TO315.EXE, or you really have a corrupted LORD.DAT file.

  (If this is simply the first time you've run LORD, hit A!)

  Here are your choices:

û (A) Create a NEW LORD.DAT file with defaults
  (C) Drop to Dos, and forget the whole thing

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Here, you have two choices. You can either hit:

   (A) Create a NEW LORD.DAT file with defaults, or
   (B) Drop to Dos, and forget the whole thing.

   Since we are installing Legend of the Red Dragon for the first time, we need
to hit A or ENTER. See the little checkmark? When it is beside a choice you
would like to make, hit ENTER. It's kinda the default thing. You can also move
it with the arrow keys and select the option by hitting ENTER.

   Now, we've selected option A, and Legend of the Red Dragon will present us
with another neat little screen:

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   (T)urn "On Now" stat off for all players - If the game says that a player is
   still in the game, and you know he is not, this will toggle the ON flag for
   all players. Useful if the game locks up and says it still has players in
   there.

   (F)ix Marriage Problems - Some systems have everyone married to player 0 when
   they upgrade from 3.20a to 4.02 . Use this option only ONCE! It will unmarry
   everyone in the game and correct the problem.

   Here's each option explained:

   (1) Node Number - This is the current node being edited for the BBS. If you
   have a multi-node system, set up one node, and just keep changing this number
   for each node. Legend of the Red Dragon will use the defaults you set up on
   node 1 for all of the subsequent nodes.

Legend of the Red Dragon 4.02                                  Page 16
   (2) BBS Name - Put the name of your BBS here.... (Well, duuh!)

   (3) BBS Software - This does not necessarily mean *what* software you run,
   this is the type of dropfile Legend of the Red Dragon will be looking for.
   When you hit ENTER on it, LORDCFG will present you with a list of the
   dropfiles it can accept:

                    (1) QBBS (Using DORINFOx.DEF)
                    (2) PCBoard12 (Using PCBOARD.SYS)
                    (3) WWIV (Using CHAIN.TXT)
                    (4) PCBoard15 (Using PCBOARD.SYS)
                    (5) RBBS16+ (Using DORINFOx.DEF)
                    (6) Phoenix (Using INFO.BBS)
                    (7) Wildcat (Using CALLINFO.BBS)
                    (8) PCBoard14 (Using PCBOARD.SYS)
                    (9) DOORSYS (Using DOOR.SYS)
                    (A) Spitfire (Using SFDOORS.DAT)
                    (B) 2am-bbs (Using JUMPER.DAT)
                    (C) TriBBS (Using TRIBBS.SYS)
                    (D) Local (Does not use drop file)

   If you don't see your BBS type listed here, consult the documentation that
   came with your BBS package.

   NOTE FOR WILDCAT 3 & 4 SYSOPS: Wildcat now uses the standard 52-line DOOR.SYS
   dropfile now. It *does not* use CALLINFO.BBS any more.

   If you have a local node set up for your personal use only, you can choose
   (D) Local. But, since most BBS packages create dropfiles for all nodes, go
   ahead and choose one that your BBS uses anyway.

   (4) Path to Drop File - Set this to the path where your BBS will create its
   dropfile. If you are unsure where your BBS creates the dropfile at, consult
   your documentation. *MOST* BBS packages will put the dropfiles in the main
   BBS directory.

   (5) Fossil Internal - This tells Legend of the Red Dragon how it will handle
   the communications with your modem. You have three choices here:

               Internal Com Routines
               Using Extended Fossil Driver
               Using Regular Fossil Driver

        Internal Com Routines - Legend of the Red Dragon will attempt to use the
        internal communications routines written into the game.

        Using Extended Fossil Driver - Legend of the Red Dragon will attempt to
        use an extended fossil driver for communications support.

        Using Regular Fossil Driver - This is a plain-jane FOSSIL driver like
        BNU or X00. If Legend of the Red Dragon keeps booting the player, try
        this one first. BUT, you *must* make sure you have a FOSSIL driver
        loaded before you run the game.

   (6) Locked Port Speed - If you have the communications port locked on your
   BBS, then, you need to lock it here as well. If you do not, users could get
   booted, or lose some of the screens in the game. When you select this,
   LORDCFG asks you what baud rate. Supported bauds are:

                  (1) Port Not Locked
                  (2) 2400
                  (3) 9600
                  (4) 14400
                  (5) 19200
                  (6) 38400
                  (7) 57600
                  (8) 64000
                  (9) 115200

   (7) Comport - This is where Legend of the Red Dragon needs to know where to
   look for your communications port. Most BBS packages write the COM port in
   the dropfile, but if Legend of the Red Dragon can't find it, you'll have to
   set it here. When you select this option, LORDCFG will ask:

                  (1) Set Com Port Number
                  (2) Nonstandard Comport (lets you set port, irq and hex        
                      address)
                  (3) Read Standard Com Port From The Drop File (Default)

        (1) Set Com Port Number - Legend of the Red Dragon will ask for a COM
        port number.
        (2) Nonstandard Comport - If you run a multi-node BBS with nonstandard
        COM ports and IRQ's, or you use a DigiBoard, you can set them here.
        (3) Read Standard Com Port from the Drop File - Legend of the Red Dragon
        will look in the dropfile for the COM port.

   (8) Send Open Comport Commands - Try changing this if you are having problems
   with Legend of the Red Dragon, or you just want to experiment.

   (9) Send Reset Comport Commands - Try changing this if you are having
   problems with Legend of the Red Dragon, or you just want to experiment.

   (A) Use Special ANSI Settings - Change this if players have ASCII set as
   their default terminal emulation, and they are still getting ANSI screens.

   (B) Use Direct Screen Writes - Change this if you are having "bleeding"
   problems with the screen-refreshing.

   (Q)uit to Main - No explanation necessary. Quits and Saves, and returns you
   to the Main Menu of LORDCFG.

   Now, Quit and Save your information, and let's get the game options
configured!

   Here's a more detailed explanation of each Game Option:

   (D)eletion Grace Period is Currently 15 days - This option allows you to set
   the MAXIMUM number of days that a player can miss before he is deleted out of
   the game.

   (G)SZ Path and Name - This option allows you to set a path for an external
   protocol driver so that in-game downloading of LORDICONS.ZIP is possible.
   This needs to be set if you know some players will be using RIPTerm. If you
   cannot get the in-game downloading of LORDICONS.ZIP to work, add the file
   somewhere on your BBS so your users can download it from there.

   (3) Giving credit to NO ONE! for registering - You an optionally add your
   name, or if a user registered Legend of the Red Dragon, you can put his name
   here as well. Leaving it blank will just show "REGISTERED!" in the title
   screen.
   {*} Registered Only

   (4) Multinode Support - This option allows you to toggle multi-node support
   for Legend of the Red Dragon. If you run a multi-node BBS, then you would
   most likely want this option set to YES.

   (F)orest Fights Per Day - This option allows you to increase the number of
   forest fights per day that a player is allowed to have. It is recommended
   that you do not set this higher than 30. Giving a player more than 30 forest
   fights per day means that they will advance through the game rather rapidly.
   Lowering it to a number lower than 15 will make the game move real slow! 
   {*} Registered Only

   (H)uman Fights per Day - This option determines how many user battles, or
   player fights he is allowed per day. Setting this to a number greater than 3
   means that everybody in the game gets slaughtered. {* Registered Only}


Legend of the Red Dragon 4.02                                  Page 19
   (C)lean Mode - If you run a good wholesome family BBS, turn this on. This
   option toggles whether or not if players can get laid by Violet or Seth Able
   the Bard. Legend of the Red Dragon will announce proudly when someone got
   laid.

   (B)ank Options, Transfer Funds - This option determines whether or not
   players are allowed to transfer gold from their bank account into another
   player's bank account.

   (M)ax Bank Transfer Amount - This determines the maximum amount of gold a
   player is allowed to transfer to another player's bank account.

   (P)er Day, How many Bank Transfers - This option sets the maximum number of
   gold transfers a player is allowed in one day. You can also set this to "No
   Limit" if you choose.

   (R)eset EVERYTHING - Use this only in extreme cases! When you choose this,
   Legend of the Red Dragon will empty out all player records, and everything
   else. Note: Legend of the Red Dragon will not reset itself when a player
   finishes the game. He will only be reset back to level 1.

   (*) PRINT REGISTRATION FORM - This option allows you to print out a
   registration form for Legend of the Red Dragon. Make sure your printer is
   ready to print before selecting this. Also, see Chapter 1, Registering Legend
   of the Red Dragon.

   (X) TXT & ANS Paths - If you would like Legend of the Red Dragon to keep an
   updated score file available for viewing through your BBS, be sure to define
   your paths AND filenames here.

   (Q)uit - Quits to the Main Menu.
